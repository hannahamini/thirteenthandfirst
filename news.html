      <h2> Fire Breaks Out At Checkers, Zero Injured </h2>

      <div class="story">
      <p id="date"> March 9, 2019 <br></p>
      <p>
        East Village, NY&mdash;On Saturday night, the FDNY responded to reports of a fire at a Checkers restaurant on 1st Avenue. <br><br>

        There were no reported injuries. <a href="https://i.citizen.com/-L__-An7Z6fo44kod2dt">According to firefighters, it is probable that the fire began in the walls of the building</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Firefighters arrived on the scene and immediately tried to gain access to the Checkers and the apartment building above the restaurant. One crew could be seen entering a second-floor apartment through a window to canvas the area for victims while another stayed outside to tear through the awning of the restaurant.

        The upwards of seven firetrucks lined along the block attracted a large crowd. Responders set up caution tape to keep onlookers outside of the scene. They waited aside with emergency medical gear incase victims were found through further searches.

        The amount of responders on the scene dwindled after the fire had been brought under control and additional searches concluded a lack of victims. Some stayed behind to clean up the scene well into the night. <br><br><br>
