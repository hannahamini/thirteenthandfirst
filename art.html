        <p id="question">
          What’s your background?
        </p>

        <p>
        Zeso: My first contact with graffiti was in my home town of Lyon, France around 1995. With some friends and my older sister, I started by tagging the street around the neighborhood we came from. <br><br>

Around 2001, I gradually moved into creating street art with bigger and more colorful compositions. <br><br>

In 2005, I moved to New York where I developed a more personal style. I kept the graffiti base, added some more character and element, then composed the graphic universe of my work. <br><br>

In 2016, I was deported back to France. I started to focus my work on canvas more than on walls to work on a solo exhibition called “2005-2016 Deported”, where I painted my ten years of memories in the United States. <br><br>

I currently live in Barcelona, Spain. <br><br>

        <p id="question">
          What’s the story behind these pieces?
        </p>

        <p>
        Zeso: The wall on the left is commission work from a barbershop close by, <a href="https://onthemark.nyc/">On The Mark</a>. The owner told me that he liked to play music and offer his customers expensive liquor, so I made sure to add bottles and a boombox with the character. <br><br>

The wall in the middle was part of a promotional event for a night club. I been contacted by a woman working for night club to help promote a special event with DJ and ballerina. I kept my painting of the DJ up, but I have since painted over the ballerina with new work. <br><br>

My last piece on the right started with simple sketches from the day before. I had an idea to create lettering with its base stuck to a light house. I thought it would be interesting to paint here because the brick wall and the lettering would have a contrast of color and texture. <br><br>
        </p>

        <p id="question">
          What inspires you?
        </p>

        <p>
          Zeso: After painting for over 20 years, I have never found any reason to paint other than to simply have fun. There are no is political or ideological messages behind my art work walls, and I want keep it like this, I don’t want to pollute my passion with something than can affect the joy of simple paint. <br><br>

          So, maybe, the inspiration behind my work is just to continue the journey of having good a time and trying new things with color and texture. <br><br>
        </p>

        <p id="question">
          What are you working on now?
        </p>

        <p>
          Zeso: I started visiting Japan over 20 years ago. Last winter alone I spent almost 3 months there. I find this country very interesting and beautiful, and it’s influenced my work a lot. I wanted an exhibition showing the inspiration that this culture has on my painting, and I’ve spent the past 6 months locked in my studio, spending all of my time working on it. The opening will be in May.
